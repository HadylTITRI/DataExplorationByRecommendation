# DataExplorationByRecommendation
The main purpose of this project is to test and implement an automated method of data lake NoSQL data exploaration using advanced techniques of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms, comparing and evaluating their performances and results (accuracy, the lose function, ...) . The efficacity of this proposed approch was validated using JSON files (Semi-Structered data). 
Many works of data lake data exploration exist , most of them used metadata model. So, this project proved the possibility of data mining in a big amount od data using recommandation systems.
